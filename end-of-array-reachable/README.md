# End of Array Reachable

## Description

Given an array of integers numbers where each element in the array represents the maximum number of positions that can be moved forward from that index; it is acceptable to move by fewer positions.

Determine whether it is possible to reach the last index of the array by starting from the first index. Return true if it can be reached and false otherwise.

## Input

numbers: number[]: An array of integers, each index's value is the maximum number of positions reachable from that index

## Examples

Input: numbers = [4,1,0,0,2,3]
Output: true
Explanation: Move from index 0 to 4, then move 1 position to the last index.

Input: numbers = [1,0,0,0]
Output: false
Explanation: Can only move from index 0 to index 1 and no further movements thereafter, so it impossible to reach the last index.

Input: numbers = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: true
Explanation: Move 1 position forward from index 0 to index 1 (it is allowed to move up to 2 positions, but going to index 1 first allows us to move further). From index 1, move 3 positions to reach the last index.
