# Array Product Excluding Current

## Description

Given an array of integers numbers, return a new array result where each element result[i] represents the product of all the elements in numbers except for numbers[i].

## Input

numbers: number[]: An array of integers

## Notes

The product of any prefix or suffix of the numbers array is ensured to fit within a 32-bit integer
Use of the division operator is prohibited

## Examples

Input: numbers = [1,2,3]
Output: [6,3,2]
Explanation: Output is multiplication of all other elements except self, i.e 2*3, 1*3, 1\*2

Input: numbers = [2,0,3]
Output: [0,6,0]
Explanation: Output is multiplication of all other elements except self, i.e 0*3, 2*3, 2\*0

Input: numbers = [0,0,-1,1]
Output: [0,0,0,0]
Explanation: Output is multiplication of all other elements except self, i.e 0*-1*1, 0*-1*1, 0*0*1, 0*0*-1
